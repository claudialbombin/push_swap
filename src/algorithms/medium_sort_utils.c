 * A plain sqrt(size) chunk length is the right asymptotic answer, but
 * it isn't the cheapest one in practice: extract_chunk's pass costs
 * the *current* size of a on every one of the size/chunk chunks (it
 * never shrinks, see extract_chunk), while sorting each isolated
 * chunk only costs O(chunk^2). That imbalance means fewer, bigger
 * chunks end up costing less overall, even though both approaches
 * are O(n * sqrt(n)). Empirically, chunk ~= 3 * sqrt(size) minimizes
 * the real op count (measured ~35% fewer operations than sqrt(size)
 * for n = 500) - found by squaring both sides to keep this an
 * integer-only search, same style as the plain sqrt(size) version.
 *
 * @param size Total number of elements to split into chunks.
 * @return The chunk length.
